You Guessed it
=====================

## Description

You Guessed It is a fun single player trivia game. The goal of You Guessed It is to get 15 questions correct, miss more than 5 and the game ends. The player has the ability to choose between multiple catagories of questions and in each catagory there are 10 questions. Each correct question is worth 1 point. If the player gets a question wrong a point will be added to the incorrect score. 

## Technologies Used

-	HTML5
-	CSS3
-	JavaScript
-	jQuery

## Approach Taken
I began by setting up the HTML, CSS, and JS files and folders. After laying out the bones of the HTML I began experimenting with JS, creating the message and question boxs which display each question and answer. I scraped my initial attempt which was creating a div for each question/answer because I couldn't get the questions to pop up at random and in seperate divs. Another reason I abandoned the initial JS is because everything was click based, therefore there was no true logic to the game. It was simply click and display. After getting help from classmates as well as the instructors, I decided to append an unordered list for my questions and answers to two individual divs. This also gave me the ability to reuse the divs to display other instructions and text. Soon after, everything displayed as needed. I added in my win and loss function, attempted to make the game look beautiful, and took a 15 minute nap before getting up to head into class for the presentations.

## Unsolved Problems
There was a couple of stretch goals that could not make it into the game. I wanted to add an actual count down timer into the div that display 3 seconds until next question. Then for the Catagory boxs, you may only choose a catagory box once, but there is no notification displaying you cannot click on the same catagory. I also wanted to add different difficulties for questions: Easy, Hard, and Medium
