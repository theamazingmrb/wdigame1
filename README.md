## Description

This game is a trivia game between two players.  Minimum one player needed to play.  The goal of the game is to win the most categories .The players will choose sides either  “Player One” or “Player 2” (can also play as teams). If there is more than one player, the game will randomly choose who gets to go first.  Once the player is chosen they then have the ability to choose a difficulty for their questions (“Easy”, “Hard”, and “Mix”). Once the difficulty is chosen the player then will be presented with five questions. If the player gets the question incorrect the other Player then has the opportunity to steal the round. First player to reach three correct questions wins the category. Points are earned by winning categories. Players will choose how long they would like the game to last (Best out of 3, 5, or 7).

## Technologies Used

## Approach Taken
I began by setting up the HTML, CSS, and JS, files and folders. After laying out the bones of the HTML I began experimenting with JS creating the message and question boxs which display my questions and answer. I scraped my initial attempt which was creating a div for each questions answer. Another reason I abbodoned innitial JS, everything was click based, there was no true logic to the game, There was simply click and display. After getting help from Classmates as well as the Instructors, I decided to append unordered list for my Questions and answer to two individual divs. This also gave me the ability to reuse the divs to display other instructions and text. Soon after, everything displayed as needed. I added in my win and loss function, attempted to make the game look beautiful, and took a 15 minute nap before getting up to head into class for the presentations.

## Unsolved Problems
There was a couple of strecth goals that could not make it into the game. I wanted to add an actual count down timer into the div that display 3 seconds until next question. For the Catagory boxs you may only choose a catagory box once, but I did not get a red X or notification saying you cannot click on the same catagory. I also wanted to add different difficulties for questions: Easy, Hard, and Medium
